        "title": "Measuring Nucleosome Assembly Activity in vitro with the Nucleosome Assembly and Quantification (NAQ) Assay",
        "original description": "Nucleosomes organize the eukaryotic genome into chromatin. In cells, nucleosome assembly relies on the activity of histone chaperones, proteins with high binding affinity to histones. At least a subset of histone chaperones promotes histone deposition in vivo. However, it has been challenging to characterize this activity, due to the lack of quantitative assays. \n\nHere we developed a quantitative nucleosome assembly (NAQ) assay to measure the amount of nucleosome formation in vitro. This assay relies on a Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion step that yields DNA fragments protected by the deposited histone proteins. A subsequent run on the Bioanalyzer machine allows the accurate quantification of the fragments (length and amount), relative to a loading control. This allows us to measure nucleosome formation by following the signature DNA length of ~150 bp. This assay finally enables the characterization of the nucleosome assembly activity of different histone chaperones, a step forward in the understanding of the functional roles of these proteins in vivo.",
        "steps": "\n\n1. Micrococcal Nuclease digestion and DNA purification\n2. Take 25 \u00b5l of the nucleosome assembly reaction and mix with 10 \u00b5l of 10x MNase buffer, 1 \u00b5l 100x BSA, 1 \u00b5l of MNase (stock at 25 U/\u00b5l) and 63 \u00b5l of water.\n3. Incubate for 10 min in a thermoblock at 37 \u00b0C\n4. Quench the reaction by adding 10 \u00b5l of 500 mM EDTA (final EDTA concentration ~50 mM).\n5. Optional: Treat the sample with 25 \u00b5g of Proteinase K (1.25 \u00b5l of a 20 mg/ml solution) for 20 min at 50 \u00b0C.\n6. Add 550 \u00b5l of PB buffer from MinElute kit (QIAGEN) and 10 \u00b5l of 3 M Na acetate pH 5.0 solution.\n7. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\n8. Add 50 ng of loading control DNA (stock at 25 ng/\u00b5l).\n9. Apply sample to the spin column.\n10. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.\n11. Discard flow-through.\n12. Wash membrane with 100 \u00b5l of PB buffer.\n13. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.\n14. Discard flow-through.\n15. Wash membrane with 700 \u00b5l of PE buffer.\n16. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.\n17. Discard flow-through.\n18. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.\n19. Discard flow-through.\n20. Apply 10 \u00b5l of ddH2O to the spin column (make sure the tip of the pipette is in the center of the membrane).\n21. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\n22. Place spin column into a clean Eppendorf tube.\n23. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.\n",
