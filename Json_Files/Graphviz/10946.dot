    // Define steps
    Step1 [label="1. Thaw frozen aorta in a 37°C waterbath, mince on ice, and pool aortas from 3-4 mice in a single microtube.\nFor VSMCs, wash cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times, aspirate the PBS thoroughly."];
    Step2 [label="2. Prepare SMAD lysis buffer:\n- 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6\n- 1% Triton X-100\n- 100 mM NaCl\n- 2 mM EDTA\n- 10% v/v glycerol\n- 50 mM NaF\n- 20 mM Na4P207\n- 2 mM Na3VO4\n- 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque)"];
    Step3 [label="3. Lyse pooled minced aortas or VSMCs in 100 or 150 µL lysis buffer for each microtube (around 30 mg tissue) or 35 mm dish, respectively."];
    Step4 [label="4. Use a homogenizer (for aortas) followed by a sonicator to further lyse the tissue.\nUse a sonicator to process VSMC samples."];
    Step5 [label="5. Centrifuge 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C."];
    Step6 [label="6. Transfer supernatant into a new microtube."];
    Step7 [label="7. Measure protein concentration using Pierce 660nm Protein Assay Reagent. Make a BSA standard curve as well to plot the absorbance into the concentration value."];
    Step8 [label="8. Add 5x SDS loading dye, boil at 95°C for 3-5 min."];
    Step9 [label="9. Store at -20°C until used."];
