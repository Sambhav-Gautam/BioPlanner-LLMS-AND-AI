    Step1 [label="1. PCR reactions for 12S were performed with a two-step amplification protocol for each sample using the MiFish_U primers (Miya et al., 2015)."];
    Step2 [label="2. The primary PCR amplifications were carried out in triplicate 20 μl reactions using:\n2 µl gDNA extract template (1:10 dilution)\n10 µl Hotstar MasterMix (2X) (Qiagen, USA)\n0.8 µl of each untagged forward and reverse primer (10 µM)\n7.2 µl molecular biology grade water"];
    Step3 [label="3. PCR reactions were performed in 8-well strip tubes with a no template control (NTC) for each group of environmental sample triplicates and artificial community as a positive control per amplification round using the 12S primary PCR primers:\n12S MiFish_U (forward): GTC GGT AAA ACT CGT GCC AGC\n12S MiFish_U (reverse): CAT AGT GGG GTA TCT AAT CCC AGT TTG"];
    Step4 [label="4. Primary 12S cycling parameters:\n95 °C for 5 minutes\n40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 55 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 30 seconds\nHeld at 4 °C"];
    Step5 [label="5. Secondary PCR amplifications are conducted in triplicate 20 μl reactions using same reaction master mix as primary PCR, but with 0.8 µl of each tagged 12S forward and reverse primer (10 µM):\n12S (forward): NNN XXX XXX GTC GGT AAA ACT CGT GCC AGC\n12S (reverse): NNN XXX XXX CAT AGT GGG GTA TCT AAT CCC AGT TTG"];
    Step6 [label="6. The reaction is carried through with 2 µl of each purified environmental as well as positive and NTC samples."];
    Step7 [label="7. Secondary 12S tagged PCR cycling parameters:\n95 °C for 5 minutes\nTwenty cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 57 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 30 seconds\nHeld at 4 °C"];
    
    // Define steps for Quality control, PCR clean-up
    Step8 [label="8. After PCR amplification of the marker region, the pooled PCR products were run through an agarose gel to confirm the presence of target bands and absence of non-specific amplification across environmental samples as well as the absence of amplification in no-template controls (NTCs)."];
    Step9 [label="9. PCR products were purified and size selected using the Agencourt AMPure XP bead system (Beckman Coulter, USA)."];
    Step10 [label="10. A second agarose gel was run to confirm primer removal and retention of target amplicons after purification."];
    Step11 [label="11. Purified products were then quantified using Quant-It Picogreen dsDNA Assay (Life Technologies) on an fmax Molecular Devices Fluorometer with a Qubit dsDNA HS kit."];
    Step12 [label="12. Equimolar pools were constructed and quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS kit to confirm pool concentration prior to library preparation."];
    Step13 [label="13. One library was constructed for each location sampled in using the KAPA HyperPrep and Library Quantification kits following manufacturer’s protocol."];
    
    // Define steps for Sequencing parameters
    Step14 [label="14. 12S rRNA gene was sequenced at Stanford Functional Genomics Facility."];
    Step15 [label="15. The pooled product for each genetic locus was loaded on a standard MiSeq v2 flow cell and sequenced in a 2x250bp paired end format using a v2 500-cycle MiSeq reagent cartridge."];
    Step16 [label="16. The MiSeq run was performed and 20% PhiX was added."];
    Step17 [label="17. Base calling was done by Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.18.54 and output of RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v2.18.0."];
    Step18 [label="18. Custom sequencing primers were added to appropriate wells of the reagent cartridge:\n12S rRNA\nFK NEXTflex Library barcode 6: CTTGTA\nMB NEXTflex Library barcode 4: GCCAAT"];
