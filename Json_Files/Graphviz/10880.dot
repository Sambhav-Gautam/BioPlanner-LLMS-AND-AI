    Step1 [label="1. This protocol requires 90% ethanol kept at -20\u00b0C. All the equipment (pipetman, bench....) has to be decontaminated with a RNAse AWAY solution. The tips and tubes have to be RNAse free. Wear gloves during all the procedure."];
    Step2 [label="2. Grow 1L of Asterionella formosa culture to an optical density at 600nm (OD600) of 0.12."];
    Step3 [label="3. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3,200g at 16\u00b0C in a swinging rotor for 15 min. Discard the supernatant. Proceed with the pellet."];
    Step4 [label="4. Add 4 mL of TRIzol Reagent to the harvested cells (roughly 360 mg)."];
    Step5 [label="5. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min."];
    Step6 [label="6. Split the 4 mL samples into 4 samples of 1 mL each in Eppendorf tubes."];
    Step7 [label="7. Add 200 \u03bcL of chloroform to each sample and shake vigorously."];
    Step8 [label="8. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min."];
    Step9 [label="9. Centrifuge for 15 min at 4\u00b0C at maximal speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge."];
    Step10 [label="10. Collect the aqueous phase from each tube using a needle syringe (top phase, about 0.6 mL per tube) and split into aliquots of 200 \u03bcL each."];
    Step11 [label="11. Add 375 \u03bcL of RNA dilution buffer (blue solution) to each aliquot and gently mix by shaking."];
    Step12 [label="12. Centrifuge for 10 min at maximal speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 4\u00b0C."];
    Step13 [label="13. Collect the supernatant, which should be about 500 \u03bcl per tube. A blue pellet may sometimes be present."];
    Step14 [label="14. Add 250 \u03bcL of 90% ethanol kept at -20\u00b0C to each supernatant sample (of ~500 \u03bcL) from the previous step."];
    Step15 [label="15. Continue from step 7 of the SV Total RNA Isolation System Protocol."];
