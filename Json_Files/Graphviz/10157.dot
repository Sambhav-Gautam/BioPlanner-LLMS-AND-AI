    Step1 [label="1. Inoculate single colony of freshly transformed DH5α or TOP10 cells in 4 ml LB medium containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol (or appropriate antibiotic)."];
    Step2 [label="2. Grow the culture overnight at 37°C with shaking (250 rpm)."];
    Step3 [label="3. Next day re-inoculate the cultures into 4 ml fresh LB medium having antibiotics and varying inducer concentrations.\nInducer concentrations can be varied from 0-1mM of IPTG or 0-200 ng/ml aTc."];
    Step4 [label="4. Collect the samples at different time intervals of 3, 6, and 9 hours."];
    Step5 [label="5. Monitor the growth rate by measuring optical density at 600 nm."];
    Step6 [label="6. Measure the fluorescence in a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon laser and a 515-545 nm emission filter (FL-1) and a 585-610 nm emission filter (FL-2)."];
    Step7 [label="7. To measure the fluorescence, add 3-5 μl of the growing culture in ~1 ml PBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH-7.5)."];
    Step8 [label="8. Measurement should be done at low flow rate (~1000 events/second)."];
    Step9 [label="9. For each sample, collect 50,000 events."];
    Step10 [label="10. Analyze the fluorescence in both FL-1 and FL-2 channel using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences)."];
    Step11 [label="11. Determine the background fluorescence by using controls (cells having empty plasmid vector)."];
