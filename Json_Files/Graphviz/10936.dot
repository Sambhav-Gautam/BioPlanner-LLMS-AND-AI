    Step1 [label="1. Sacrifice mouse (10-week old, Balb/c) with an overdose intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital."];
    Step2 [label="2. Dip the mouse into a beaker filled with 70% ethanol, fix into an operation tray, bring into laminar air flow."];
    Step3 [label="3. With sterilized surgical instruments, open the mouse, dissect the thoracic aorta."];
    Step4 [label="4. Wash the aorta in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS)."];
    Step5 [label="5. Keep the aorta in a dish on ice, remove the connective tissue and the adventitia."];
    Step6 [label="6. Transfer into a new dish with fresh HBSS."];
    Step7 [label="7. Cut open the aorta longitudinally, remove the endothelial layers by gentle scrape with a sterile cotton swab."];
    Step8 [label="8. Cut the aorta into 4 pieces (around 4 mm2 each), wash in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F12 (DMEM/F12) (Gibco)."];
    Step9 [label="9. Transfer the aorta pieces into a collagen-coated culture dish (35 mm), press with the luminal side down on the dish."];
    Step10 [label="10. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a tilting position."];
    Step11 [label="11. Check and make sure the media explant attached to the dish. Prolonged the incubation for another 1-3 minutes if necessary."];
    Step12 [label="12. Very slowly add fresh medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics to just cover the aorta."];
    Step13 [label="13. Place the dish in the incubator and left undisturbed for 4 days."];
    Step14 [label="14. At day 5, add fresh medium and change every 3 days. Observe the migrated cells under a microscope."];
    Step15 [label="15. When migrated cells are confluent, harvest with trypsinization."];
    Step16 [label="16. Count and pool cells from media explants from 3 mice into one dish (0.5-1x10^5 cells/35 mm dish), culture in 10% FBS/DMEM/F12."];
