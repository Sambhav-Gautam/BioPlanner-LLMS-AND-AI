    Step1 [label="1. Prepare 50mL of 10% FBS RPMI media"];
    Step2 [label="2. Wet both sides of a 70Î¼m filter with media above a 50mL conical (make sure there is some media in the conical)"];
    Step3 [label="3. Place spleen on filter, use the plunger base of a syringe to mash the spleen onto the filter while pouring media through"];
    Step4 [label="4. Continue pouring media through filter while mashing until spleen is completely mashed. About 30 to 35mL of media should be used"];
    Step5 [label="5. Keep suspended cells on ice in the 10% FBS RPMI media until preparing for sort"];
    Step6 [label="6. Spin cells down at 350g for 3 min (pulse to 550g if necessary)"];
    Step7 [label="7. Remove supernatant"];
    Step8 [label="8. Resuspend pellet in 1mL of ACK lysing buffer for 1 min on ice"];
    Step9 [label="9. Add 30mL of media, spin down at 350g for 3 min (pulse to 550g if necessary)"];
    Step10 [label="10. Stain with desired antibodies, filter with sorting filters, dilute if large pellet"];
