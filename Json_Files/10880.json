    "title": "RNA extraction from the pennate diatom Asterionella formosa",
    "original description": "Asterionella formosa is a freshwater diatom and as such as a silica cell wall. Therefore classical protocols for RNA extraction do no work.\u00a0 We have settled this protocol that gives high quality RNA (tested by NGS). This protocol was also applied to marine diatoms, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum and gave very good yields.",
    "steps": "\nBefore starting\n1. This protocol requires 90% ethanol kept at -20\u00b0C. All the equipment\u00a0 (pipetman, bench....) has to be decontaminated with a RNAse AWAY solution. The tips and tubes have to be RNAse free. Wear gloves during all the procedure.\n\nPreparing cells\n2. 1L of Asterionella formosa culture should be grown to an optical density at 600nm (OD600) of 0.12.\n\n\n3. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3 200g at 16\u00b0c in a swinging rotor for 15min. Discard the supernatant. With the pellet, follow the protocol below.\n\nRNA extraction\n4. Add 4 ml of TRIzol Reagent to the harvested cells (roughly 360 mg).\nreagents\n\n\n5. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\n6. Split the 4 mL samples into 4 samples of 1 mL each (in eppendorf tubes).\n7. Add 200 \u03bcL of chloroform to each sample and shake vigorously.\nNOTES For this step, pure chloroform is necessary. A solution of chloroform and isoamyl alcohol should not be used as a substitute.\n8. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n9. Centrifuge for 15 min at 4\u00b0C at maximal speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge.\n10. Collect the aqueous phase from each tube whith a needle syringe (top phase, about 0.6 mL per tube) and split into aliquots of 200 \u03bcL each.\n11. Add 375 \u03bcL of RNA dilution buffer from the SV Total RNA Isolation System kit (blue solution) to each aliquot and gently mix by shaking.\nreagents\n12. Centrifuge for 10 min at maximal speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 4\u00b0C.\n13. Collect the supernatant, which should be about 500 \u03bcl per tube. A blue pellet may sometimes be present.\n14. Add 250 \u03bcL of 90% ethanol kept at -20\u00b0C to each supernatant sample (of ~500 \u03bcL) from the previous step.\n15. Continue from step 7 of the SV Total RNA Isolation System Protocol.\nTip as many tubes as possible into the Spin Basket Assembly (between 12 and 13 tubes). \nimageblocka\nreagents\n",
