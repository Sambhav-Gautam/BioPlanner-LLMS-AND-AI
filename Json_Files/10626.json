    "title": "\"Isolating Specific Cell Subsets Directly from Whole Blood Without Columns or Magnets\"",
    "original description": "The following procedure provides guidelines for isolating cells from whole blood using RosetteSep\u2122, an immunodensity cell separation platform that isolates specific cell subsets during density gradient centrifugation. RosetteSep\u2122 first crosslinks unwanted cells to red blood cells (RBCs) present in the sample to form immunorosettes. When the sample is centrifuged over a density gradient medium (e.g. Lymphoprep\u2122), the immunorosettes pellet, leaving highly purified cells at the interface between the plasma and the density gradient medium.",
    "steps": "\n\n1. Ensure that the blood sample, PBS + 2% FBS (phosphate-buffered saline + 2% fetal bovine serum), density gradient medium, and centrifuge are all at room temperature (15 - 25\u00b0C).\nNOTES For a high-throughput protocol for NK cell and lymphocyte isolation, please see the ?Guidelines.\n2. Add RosetteSep\u2122 cocktail to the sample and mix well.\n3. Incubate 20 minutes at room temperature.\n1200s\n4. Dilute sample with an equal volume of PBS + 2% FBS and mix gently.\n5. Layer the diluted sample on top of the density gradient medium using the recommended volumes (see note). Be careful to minimize mixing of the density gradient medium and the sample.\nNOTES ?\n6. Centrifuge at 1200 x g for 20 minutes at room temperature, with the brake off.\n1200s\n7. Remove the enriched cells from the density gradient medium:plasma interface.\n8. Sometimes it is difficult to see cells at the interface, especially when very rare cells are enriched. To maximize recovery in these instances, remove some of the density gradient medium along with the enriched cells.\n9. Wash enriched cells with PBS + 2% FBS, centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min, with brake on low. Discard supernatant. (1/2).\n600s \nNOTES We recommend that residual red blood cells are removed from samples by ammonium chloride lysis to reduce interference with subsequent assays or with flow cytometric analysis. The lysis can be performed as part of either wash step.\n10. Wash enriched cells with PBS + 2% FBS, centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min, with\u00a0brake\u00a0on low. Discard supernatant. (2/2)\n600s \nNOTES To remove residual RBCs, perform lysis with ammonium chloride as part of either wash step.\n11. Use enriched cells as desired.\n",
