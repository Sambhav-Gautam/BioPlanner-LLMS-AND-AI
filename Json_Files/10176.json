    "title": "Personality assessment protocol",
    "original description": "This protocal characterized each focal fish (western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis) for three standard indicators of personality using well-established experimental approaches: (1) boldness as latency to emerge from shelter and enter an unknown area, (2) activity in an open field tank and (3) sociability (i.e., shoaling tendencies), estimated as the time spent in the vicinity of a group of conspecifics. We tested each fish twice for its personality on two successive days, which allowed us to test for behavioral repeatability across both assessments.",
    "steps": "\n\n1. To initiate a trial, we introduced the focal individual into a lateral shelter area (20 \u00d7 30 cm) of the testing tank, which was separated from the rest of the tank by an opaque trap door. The shelter area contained small stones and artificial plants for the fish to hide. We gave the focal fish 2 min for acclimatization before the trapdoor was remotely opened by a pulley system. We determined the latency the test subject needed to emerge from shelter, which is a common measure of boldness in fish, with bolder fish emerging faster. We terminated a trial after a maximum ceiling value of 5 min (i.e., if the focal fish did not leave the starting area) and gently moved the fish outside the container with the help of a small aquarium dip net.\n2. Afterwards, we closed the trapdoor and let the fish explore the tank for 5 min before we started quantifying swimming activity. This habituation period was important as we were interested in individuals\u2019 activity levels rather than exploration of a novel environment. Even shorter periods of time for habituation were successfully employed in studies on individuals\u2019 activity levels in other poeciliid species. We counted numbers of squares crossed by the focal fish in the test arena (60 \u00d7 30 cm) within 5 min, assuming that more active fish would cross more grid squares.\n3. Directly after the activity assessment, we removed a black cardboard divider that had blocked visual contact with a stimulus shoal that was situated in another tank (20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15 cm), adjacent to the small side of the test tank opposite of the starting area. Physical and chemical contact between fish residing in different tanks was not possible, leaving only visual cues as a potential stimulus. The tank contained three stimulus fish (SL, females: 28.46 \u00b1 5.41 mm; males: 22.74 \u00b1 3.33 mm), which were exchanged between trials. To avoid effects of sexual attraction and familiarity on shoaling behavior, we presented stimulus shoals of the same sex, and fish used to compose stimulus shoals were taken from a different stock tank than the one from which the focal fish stemmed. We waited until the focal individual habituated to the new situation and resumed swimming freely. During a 5 min observation period, we determined the time the focal individual spent within a visually marked association zone (10 cm in front of the stimulus tank) as a measure of sociability/shoaling. All tests were performed consecutively in the same arena to minimize handling stress.\n",
