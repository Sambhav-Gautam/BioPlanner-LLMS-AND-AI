    "title": "Adsorbing Viruses on TEM Grids",
    "original description": "Purpose: This protocol describes how to adsorb viruses onto TEM (transmission electron microscopy) grids. The sample is allowed to sit on a hydrophilic grid and viruses adsorb onto the surface of the grid. This technique is generally used for viral lysates with high concentrations of viruses. For natural samples, use the protocol \u201cQuantitatively Depositing Viruses onto TEM Grids using an Airfuge\u201d.  Note: If purification of the viruses is necessary, refer to Ackermann and Heldal (2010) for various options.",
    "steps": "\nNone\n1. On the same day as grid prep, use glow discharge to render grids hydrophylic.\n2. Holding the grid in the tweezers, place 5 \u00b5l of viral lysate onto the shiny side of the grid (Figure 1).\nimageblocka\n3. Let the sample sit for ~3 minutes to allow the viruses to adsorb to the grid. \n180s\n4. Stain the viruses using the protocol \u201clinkPositive and Negative Staining of Viruses on TEM Grids\u201d.\n",
