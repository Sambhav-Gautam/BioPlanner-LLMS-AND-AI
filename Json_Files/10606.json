    "title": "Sex biased collecting strategy for gene expression in mealybugs",
    "original description": "This protocol was used to determine when to collect sex biased samples for RNA extraction and establish expression profile throughout mealybug development.   Sex ratio throughout oviposition was established first in Planococcus citri (Ross et al., 2010). We used the procotol that the authors established and tried it on Planococcus kraunhiae. The sex ratio variation follow a similar pattern (Vea et al., 2016).",
    "steps": "\nEgg collection\n1. Separate mated females that are about to lay eggs on sprouted potatoes or sprouted beans and wait until the first eggs.\n2. Collect embryos every 24 hours as they are laid, and fix them in 200-500 uL Carnoy fixative in a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube and store at 4\u00baC for maximum 4 days. If the embryos can only be prepared after 4 days, replace the fixative with 90-100% ethanol and store at 4\u00baC.Carnoy fixative:\n- 4 parts chloroform\n- 3 parts ethanol\n- 1 part acetic acid\n\nDAPI staining\n3. Transfer the embryos on a microscope slide, let the fixation or ethanol evaporate enough to have the slide dry but the embryo still humid.\n4. Add 20 uL of DAPI diluted in 1xPBS at 1:1000\n5. Add coverslip, seal with nailpolish and keep in the dark for\u00a010-15 min\n6. The slides can be visualized with a fluorescence compound microscope. The heterochromatin is best seen at 200x\n\nCounting embryos \n7. Each slide will have all the embryos from one day of oviposition.\nFor each slide, identify male and female embryos (see result section) and count the numbers of males and female embryos\n8. Report the sex ratio for each day of oviposition.If possible repeat the process for at least 5 females.\n9. Use Excel or R to make a graph of sex ratio\n",
