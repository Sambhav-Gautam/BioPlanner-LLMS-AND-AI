    "original description": "Basic protocol to achieve\u00a0lipofectamine transfection of\u00a0Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells with cDNA and/or\u00a0siRNA.",
    "steps": "\nPrepare\n1. One day prior to transfection, plate cells at a concentration of 500,000 cells per mL in a 12-well plate.\n2. Modify the transfection spreadsheet (attached) to calculate how much cDNA/siRNA is needed for experimental conditions. Make sure to include negative controls for the total amount of DNA or siRNA that is added.\n3. Sterilize the biosafety cabinet with 10% bleach for 20 minutes. Spray down the biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol and use UV light for 15 minutes as a secondary decontaminant.\n\nOne Hour Prior to Transfection\n4. Three wells at a time, aspirate all media from plated cells with a sterile glass pipette. Gently but quickly replace with 800 \u00b5L fresh warm complete DMEM, careful not to pipette vigorously enough to cause cells to detach.\nNOTES Note: 1 hour must pass before transfection (step 10) but keep in mind there are 25 minutes total of waiting for solutions to settle in future steps.\n\nPrepare Master Mixes\n5. According to the transfection spreadsheet, label master mixes in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each triplicate condition. First, add Opti-Mem to the master mix tubes.\nNOTES Be as accurate as possible: for example, use P1000 to add 340\u00b5L, then P20 to add remainder e.g. 12.1 \u00b5L.\n6. Double check that concentrations of cDNA/siRNA match the transfection spreadsheet. Mix thoroughly by flicking, then add the cDNA/siRNA to the Opti-Mem master mix tubes.\n7. To the lipofectamine master mix: add lipofectamine to Opti-Mem, mix well, and then let the solution sit for 5 minutes. \n300s\n8. Add the diluted lipofectamine to cDNA/siRNA at 1:1 ratio. [+350 \u00b5L] Mix well. Let solution sit for at least 20 minutes.\n1200s \n350amount\n\nTransfect\n9. On the plated cells, label wells in triplicate for each treatment. Be sure to number them to match the transfection spreadsheet. Mix the Lipofectamine + Master Mix solution thoroughly and add 200 \u00b5L of each respective mix in a careful, dropwise circular motion. Do not pipette directly on to cells in a stream.\n200amount\n\nIncubate\n10. Mix the media with very gentle shaking, then return the cells to the incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n\nFreshen Up the Media (Day 2)\n11. The next day, aspirate the old media three wells at a time and add 1 mL of warm complete DMEM media.\n\nFurther Experiments (Day 3)\n12. The following day, plan for cell lysis, protein assay, and gel sample preparation.\n",
