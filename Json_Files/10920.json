    "original description": "This describes a method to transform a plasmid into homemade DH5\u03b1 cells.",
    "steps": "\nSet up\n1. Thaw competent cells on ice. This takes about 10 minutes. Also thaw the plasmid to be transformed.\n2. Warm SOC media to room temperature.\n250amount \nNOTES LB media can also be used. Anecdotally, we haven't seen a difference between LB and SOC.\n3. Heat a dry block to 42\u00baC, a shaker-incubator to 37\u00baC, and a cabinet-style incubator to 37\u00baC.\n4. Label a 1.5mL eppendorf tube for each transformation reaction with the construct name and place it on ice. Label an agar plate with the construct, date, your initials, and plate media type (with antibiotic, if applicable).\nRESULT Plate: pYPQ131A  13 March 2018   AR   LB+Tet\n\nHeat Shock\n5. Add plasmid to the labeled eppendorf tube on ice.\n2amount\n6. Add thawed competent cells to the tube with the plasmid and gently swirl with the pipet tip to mix.\n45amount \nNOTES DO NOT vortex. Competent cells have very specific and fragile cell membranes that can be damaged by vortexing.\n7. Incubate the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.\n1800s \nNOTES This time is fungible. Longer is better, but as short as 5 minutes will also work.\n8. Place the mixture in the dry block at 42\u00baC for 30 seconds\n30s\n9. Incubate the mixture on ice for 2 minutes.\n120s\n\nGrow Up\n10. Add SOC to the mixture and shake\u00a0in an incubator\n3600s \n250amount\n11. (Optional)\u00a0Spin the bacterial broth for 30 seconds at 6000 rpm, removed 180\u00b5L of supernatant, and gently resuspend the pellet in the remaining media to concentrate.\n30s\n\nPlate\n12. Immerse a plate spreader in 70% ethanol\u00a0to sterilize and then burn off the excess alcohol.\n13. Pipet at least 100\u00b5L of the broth onto the labeled agar plate and spread it evenly across the surface of the agar with the sterile spreader. Restilerize the spreader.\nNOTES A larger volume can be used, or you can make two plates with different volumes (e.g. 100 and 50\u00b5L) to prevent getting colonies that are too close together.\n14. Place the prepared plate (lid-down) into a 37\u00baC incubator overnight (16 hours)\nNOTES The plates can also be incubated at room temperature for several days (the weekend).\n",
